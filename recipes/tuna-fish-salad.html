     <!--Definicion del plato-->
     <p>This tuna fish is excellent served on top of a green salad or between two pieces of bread with fresh lettuce. Sprinkle a little paprika on top to add a little flavor and color.</p>

     <p>Tuna salad is a light and fresh comfort food classic. Made with a few simple ingredients such as canned tuna, mayonnaise, onion and celery, it's the perfect combination of creamy and crispy. Serve this in a sandwich, wrap it in lettuce, or stuff it in avocado halves for a healthy, throw-together lunch.</p>
